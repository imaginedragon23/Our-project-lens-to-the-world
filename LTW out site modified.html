        </iframe>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
        <p>American psycho is a social and philosophical movie. It is set in 1980s Manhattan showing the world of money, wealth and stockbrokers. It also shed light on excess and consumerism. The main character is Patrick Bateman, a wealthy stockbroker working in wall street. He is more than that because it turns out that he is a serial killer. Patrick suffers from schizophrenia and delusional bursts where he gave birth to his second persona the serial killer in disguise. Besides being one of the most successful bankers, he operates his second life at night by manifesting a violent urge and absolute detachment from moral principles. The movie shows many themes related to materialism and moral emptiness with a shade of darkness and satirical style where the narration takes a blurry line between reality and delusion. At the end of the movie. Patrick Bateman discovers that has been not a serial killer. And all the crime he committed were a delusion burst. He crashes out, and starts a new life full of new hope and new mind-blowing delusions. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Main Characters:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patrick Bateman:</strong> 
                The protagonist and unreliable narrator, a wealthy investment banker with a psychopathic double life as a murderer.</li>
            <li><strong>Evelyn Richards:</strong>
                Patrick's superficial and self-absorbed girlfriend, embodying the materialism of 1980s Manhattan.</li>
            <li><strong>Paul Owen:</strong>
                Patrick's professional rival and one of his victims, central to a key plot point involving his disappearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Detective Donald Kimball:</strong>
                Kimball investigates Paul Owen's disappearance. His interactions with Patrick create a tense dynamic, as Patrick tries to maintain a facade of innocence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Detailed Analysis of Camera Shots:</strong></p>
        <p>In <em>American Psycho </em> , psychological aspects of cinematography are applied in such a way that they portray the life of a sadistic man and the vanity that encompasses him up to an extent where he thrives. Bateman was a deeply envious man, who had an uncontrolled obsession with business cards. A sense of exceptional importance and uniqueness in the eyes of so called ‘higher’ society drove his spiral into madness which is perfectly illustrated in the scene where Allen breaks a car window. Violence was the only way Bateman knew how to cope with everything around him. The murder of Paul starts off with medium shots, which captures the crime perfectly in all its madness before splattering the viewers with shots of blood on Patrick’s face. Dissecting Patrick is one of the main intrigues of the film as his bewildering self-love is brilliantly conveyed through the numerous depictions of mirrors scattered throughout the film. The mirrors have a dualistic purpose of representing Patrick’s warped self-image while simultaneously allowing the audience to see Patrick without seeing Patrick himself. Body dysmorphia lies at the center of American Psycho as the portrayal of Patrick from a controlling and static camera angle throughout his professional life provides a sense of pathetically in the viewer. A vivid example of this would be American psycho’s final scenes when Patrick is being chased. His mind starts unraveling as he spirals into insanity. This why after everything ends, the impressive first impressions of an American businessman become the last of his worries. The director’s intention behind these various body dysmorphic scenes drenched in chaos is to enthrall the viewers, while providing a deeper understanding of the vanity consumed world that Bateman lived in. rather the audience and the viewers.
        <p><strong>Sound Techniques:</strong></p>
        <p>The sound design enhances the tension and immersive experience:
            The aural component of American Psycho is a significant element of psychopathy and materialism of the film. Music scores and particularly the music of the violence scenes, which include Patrick’s quintessential American 80’s pop and upbeat music, contribute to the understanding of Patrick Bateman as a reality-detached individual who hides his monstrosity under a fashionable shell. Several classic scenes, together with omnipresent coincidences that appear more humor than horror, came in contrast with some more familiar tunes like “Hip to Be Square” of Huey News Lewis and the News played at the center of gruesome terror acts. The Bucks Bauer is remarkable for its apartments sound and emphasizes his sterility which complemented his world more and Patrick needed no more than a sterile environment to sulk. Internal voices were made into full-fledged monologues conveyed by voice a feature commonly associated with self-extended and sociopathic appeals. The relationship. They Work hard for their recognition. A void of silence can equally prevail, only that sorrow tends the most dominant of feelings. In general, sound techniques in conjunction create inconsistencies between a person’s composition and the contradictions that exist in their life and this serves to enhance the assertiveness of the psychological principles exhibited throughout the movie.
